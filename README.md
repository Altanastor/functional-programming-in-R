# Functional programming in R

This is the source text to my book [Functional programming in R](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/148422745X/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=148422745X&linkCode=as2&tag=wpamazify-21&linkId=72a3075dd4b46e621f46369769be5200). I have sold the book to Apress, so I am no longer free to distribute it, and since it isn't released here with a free licence, neither are you. I leave the repository here, though, so people can see the source code. Please don't abuse this, or I will have to remove the repository.
